# Large File Upload Fix - Summary

## Problem
Large file uploads (>1MB) were failing with interruption and no error message. Progress bar would show but uploads would fail silently.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **Nginx reverse proxy configuration** that was missing `client_max_body_size` directive, which defaults to 1MB. This caused uploads larger than 1MB to be rejected by Nginx before reaching the Flask application.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Nginx Configuration (/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/his)
```nginx
# Set maximum upload size to handle large files (25MB)
client_max_body_size 25M;

# Increase proxy timeouts for large file uploads
proxy_connect_timeout 300s;
proxy_send_timeout 300s;
proxy_read_timeout 300s;
```

### 2. Flask Configuration (config.py)
- Increased `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` from 16MB to 25MB to match nginx limit

### 3. Gunicorn Configuration (/etc/systemd/system/his.service)
- Increased timeout from 120 seconds to 300 seconds (5 minutes)

### 4. JavaScript Improvements (patient_documents.js)
- Replaced jQuery AJAX with XMLHttpRequest for better control
- Added real-time upload progress bar
- Implemented comprehensive error handling:
  - Network errors
  - Timeout detection (5 minute client-side timeout)
  - Upload interruption/abort detection
  - Better error messages with HTTP status codes
- Enhanced file size validation with visual feedback

### 5. Server-side Improvements (patient_documents.py)
- Better file size validation (check both content-length and actual file size)
- Improved error messages with specific file size information
- Added defensive cleanup (remove file if database save fails)
- Enhanced error handling around file operations
- More specific HTTP status codes (413 for payload too large)

## Testing Results
✅ 1MB files: Upload successful
✅ 5MB files: Upload successful  
✅ Progress tracking: Working correctly
✅ Error handling: Proper error messages
✅ Timeout handling: 5-minute protection
✅ File cleanup: Defensive cleanup on failures

## Key Configuration Values
- **Nginx**: `client_max_body_size 25M`
- **Flask**: `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 25MB`  
- **Gunicorn**: `timeout = 300s`
- **Client**: `xhr.timeout = 300000ms`
- **Application Limit**: 20MB (with 25MB buffer for headers)

## Files Changed
1. `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/his` - Added upload limits and timeouts
2. `/root/his/config.py` - Increased Flask content length limit
3. `/etc/systemd/system/his.service` - Increased Gunicorn timeout
4. `/root/his/static/js/patient_documents.js` - Enhanced upload handling
5. `/root/his/api/patient_documents.py` - Improved validation and error handling
6. `/root/his/frontend/patient_documents.html` - Enhanced UI feedback

## Services Restarted
- `nginx` (reloaded configuration)
- `his.service` (restarted with new timeout)

The issue is now resolved and large file uploads work correctly with proper progress indication and error handling.
