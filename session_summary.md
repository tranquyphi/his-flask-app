# HIS Project - Session Summary

## Current Status
- **Project**: Health Information System (HIS) Flask Application
- **Last Updated**: Current session
- **Status**: Active development

## What We Accomplished This Session

### Configuration Improvements
- ✅ Updated `config.py` with security improvements
- ✅ Removed hardcoded database credentials
- ✅ Added configuration validation
- ✅ Enhanced environment variable support
- ✅ Added automatic log directory creation

### Departments UI Development
- ✅ Created comprehensive departments management UI (`frontend/departments.html`)
- ✅ Implemented full CRUD operations for departments
- ✅ Added department statistics dashboard
- ✅ Created JavaScript functionality (`static/js/departments.js`)
- ✅ Integrated with existing departments API endpoints

### Patients-All Route Enhancement
- ✅ Modified `/patients-all` route to use `department_patients_specific.html`
- ✅ Added department column to patients table
- ✅ Enhanced search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Fixed API import issues (`PatientsWithDepartment` class)
- ✅ Added department filter dropdown and enhanced sorting

### Service Configuration
- ✅ Updated `his.service` with secure SECRET_KEY
- ✅ Added missing environment variables
- ✅ Configured production settings
- ✅ **Service runs on port 8000 via systemd**
- ✅ **Environment variables are configured in his.service file**
- ✅ **Service is managed by systemd, not direct Python execution**

### Security Enhancements
- ✅ Generated secure SECRET_KEY using `secrets.token_hex(32)`
- ✅ Required environment variables for critical settings
- ✅ Added configuration validation
- ✅ Enhanced CORS configuration

## Current Configuration
- **Database**: MySQL with PyMySQL
- **Port**: 8000 (Gunicorn + nginx)
- **Environment**: Production
- **Service**: Active and running via systemd

## Important Service Configuration Notes

### his.service Configuration
- **Service Type**: systemd service running Gunicorn
- **Port**: 8000 (not 5000 as in development)
- **Environment Variables**: Configured in `/etc/systemd/system/his.service`
- **Database Connection**: Set via `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in service file
- **Secret Key**: Set via `SECRET_KEY` in service file
- **Management**: Use `systemctl restart his` to restart service after code changes

### Environment Variables Source
- **NOT from shell exports** - These are temporary and don't persist
- **NOT from .env files** - The service reads from systemd configuration
- **FROM his.service file** - Environment variables are declared in the service definition
- **Service restart required** - After changing environment variables or imports

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Direct `python3 his.py` (port 5000, requires shell exports)
- **Production**: systemd service (port 8000, uses service environment variables)
- **Current Setup**: Production mode via systemd service

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review and test API endpoints
- [ ] Check database schema
- [ ] Verify frontend functionality
- [ ] Test file upload limits
- [ ] Validate CORS settings

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "DB_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable is required"
- **Cause**: Trying to run `python3 his.py` directly without environment variables
- **Solution**: Use the systemd service instead: `systemctl restart his`
- **Note**: Environment variables are in `/etc/systemd/system/his.service`

#### 2. API Endpoints Returning 500 Errors
- **Cause**: Missing imports or code changes not reflected in running service
- **Solution**: Restart the service: `systemctl restart his`
- **Check**: Service logs with `journalctl -u his -f`

#### 3. Port Connection Issues
- **Development**: Use port 5000 (`python3 his.py`)
- **Production**: Use port 8000 (systemd service)
- **Test**: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint`

#### 5. Route Changes
- **Old Route**: `/patients-with-departments` (deprecated)
- **New Route**: `/patients-all` (current)
- **Functionality**: Same - shows all patients with department information

#### 4. Import Errors in API Routes
- **Cause**: Missing imports in `his.py`
- **Solution**: Add imports and restart service
- **Example**: Added `from models.PatientsWithDepartment import PatientsWithDepartment`

## Files Modified
- `config.py` - Enhanced configuration with validation
- `his.service` - Updated environment variables and security
### Some calculations (data summary) should be reviewed
