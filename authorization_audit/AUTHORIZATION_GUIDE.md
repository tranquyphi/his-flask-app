# Hospital Information System - Authorization Framework Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the complete authorization framework for the Hospital Information System (HIS), which implements **dual-layer security** based on **Staff Role** and **Department** assignments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dual-Layer Authorization
- **Layer 1**: Role-based permissions (what actions a role can perform)
- **Layer 2**: Department-based access control (where actions can be performed)
- **Layer 3**: Patient assignment (which specific patients can be accessed)

### 2. Medical Hierarchy Respect
The system respects Vietnamese hospital hierarchy:
- **B√°c sƒ©** (Doctor): Highest level, can prescribe and approve
- **ƒêi·ªÅu d∆∞·ª°ng** (Nurse): Patient care, can administer treatments
- **K·ªπ thu·∫≠t vi√™n** (Technician): Specialized tasks, test execution
- **Kh√°c** (Other): Limited access, administrative roles

## Authorization Flow

### Step-by-Step Process
```
1. User Login ‚Üí Session stores: staff_id, role, department_id, department_type
2. Action Request ‚Üí Check role permissions
3. Department Check ‚Üí Verify department access
4. Patient Check ‚Üí Verify patient assignment (if applicable)
5. Grant/Deny ‚Üí Execute action or return error
```

### Decision Matrix
```
Action Allowed = (Role Permission ‚úì) AND (Department Access ‚úì) AND (Patient Assignment ‚úì)
```

## Role-Based Permissions

### B√°c sƒ© (Doctor) - Level 4

| VisitTest | Order, review, approve |
| VisitProc | Order, perform, approve |
| Template | Create, modify, delete |

### ƒêi·ªÅu d∆∞·ª°ng (Nurse) - Level 3
**Permissions**: read, write, limited_approve
**Scope**: Assigned patients only

## Department-Based Access Control

### Standard Department Rules
- **Default**: Staff can only access their own department
- **Patients**: Must be in the same department as staff
- **Templates**: Department-specific templates only

### Special Department Permissions

#### C·∫•p c·ª©u (Emergency Department)
```python
SPECIAL_PERMISSIONS = {
    'cross_department_access': True,    # Can access patients from any department
    'emergency_override': True,         # Can override some restrictions
    'urgent_procedures': True          # Can perform urgent procedures
}
```

#### N·ªôi tr√∫ (Inpatient Department)
```python
SPECIAL_PERMISSIONS = {
    'long_term_planning': True,        # Extended treatment planning
    'full_history_access': True       # Complete patient history
}
```

#### Ph√≤ng kh√°m (Outpatient Department)
```python
SPECIAL_PERMISSIONS = {
    'outpatient_only': True,           # Limited to outpatient procedures
    'referral_system': True           # Can refer to other departments
}
```

## Database Schema Implementation

### Core Tables (Required)
From existing `exam.sql`:
- `Staff`: Contains StaffRole and DepartmentId
- `Department`: Contains DepartmentType
- `Patient`: Patient records
- `Visit`: Visit records with staff and department linkage

### Enhancement Tables (Optional)
From `authorization_enhancement.sql`:

#### User Authentication
```sql
CREATE TABLE `User` (
  `UserId` int(10) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Username` varchar(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  `PasswordHash` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `StaffId` smallint(6) NOT NULL,
  `IsActive` boolean DEFAULT 1,
  FOREIGN KEY (StaffId) REFERENCES Staff(StaffId)
);
```

#### Permission System
```sql
CREATE TABLE `Permission` (
  `PermissionId` smallint(6) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  `PermissionName` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `ResourceType` ENUM('Patient', 'Visit', 'Drug', 'Test', 'Proc', 'Template') NOT NULL,
  `Action` ENUM('create', 'read', 'update', 'delete', 'approve') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE `RolePermission` (
  `RoleId` ENUM('B√°c sƒ©', 'ƒêi·ªÅu d∆∞·ª°ng', 'K·ªπ thu·∫≠t vi√™n', 'Kh√°c') NOT NULL,
  `PermissionId` smallint(6) NOT NULL,
  `DepartmentType` ENUM('N·ªôi tr√∫', 'C·∫•p c·ª©u', 'Ph√≤ng kh√°m', 'All') DEFAULT 'All',
  PRIMARY KEY (RoleId, PermissionId, DepartmentType)
);
```

#### Patient Assignment
```sql
CREATE TABLE `StaffPatientAssignment` (
  `StaffId` smallint(6) NOT NULL,
  `PatientId` int(10) NOT NULL,
  `AssignedAt` datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `IsActive` boolean DEFAULT 1,
  PRIMARY KEY (StaffId, PatientId)
);
```

## Flask Implementation

### Authorization Decorators
```python
@require_auth                    # Requires valid login
@require_role(StaffRole.BAC_SI)  # Requires specific role
@require_permission('Drug', 'create')  # Requires specific permission
@require_department_access       # Requires department access
```

### Example Route Implementation
```python
@app.route('/api/visits/<int:visit_id>/drugs', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth
@require_role(StaffRole.BAC_SI)  # Only doctors can prescribe
@require_department_access       # Must have department access
def prescribe_drug(visit_id):
    """Prescribe drug - doctors only in same department"""
    # Implementation here
```

## Security Features

### 1. Session Management
- Staff credentials stored in secure session
- Automatic session timeout
- Role and department cached for performance

### 2. Cross-Department Access Control
- Emergency department special privileges
- Audit logging for cross-department access
- Temporary access for emergency situations

### 3. Patient Assignment System
- Nurses access only assigned patients
- Dynamic assignment updates
- Assignment history tracking

### 4. Audit Logging
- All authorization decisions logged
- Failed access attempts tracked
- Department access violations flagged

## Configuration Options

### Role Hierarchy Levels
```python
ROLE_LEVELS = {
    'B√°c sƒ©': 4,        # Highest authority
    'ƒêi·ªÅu d∆∞·ª°ng': 3,    # Patient care authority
    'K·ªπ thu·∫≠t vi√™n': 2, # Technical authority
    'Kh√°c': 1           # Basic access
}
```

### Department Access Matrix
```python
DEPARTMENT_ACCESS = {
    'C·∫•p c·ª©u': ['N·ªôi tr√∫', 'Ph√≤ng kh√°m', 'C·∫•p c·ª©u'],  # Can access all
    'N·ªôi tr√∫': ['N·ªôi tr√∫'],                            # Own department only
    'Ph√≤ng kh√°m': ['Ph√≤ng kh√°m']                       # Own department only
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Role Authorization
- Implement role-based decorators
- Basic permission checking
- Session management

### Phase 2: Department Boundaries
- Department access control
- Cross-department rules
- Emergency overrides

### Phase 3: Patient Assignment
- Nurse-patient assignments
- Fine-grained access control
- Assignment management UI

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Audit logging
- Temporary access grants
- Advanced reporting

## Testing Scenarios

### Unit Tests Required
1. **Role Permission Tests**
   - Each role's allowed actions
   - Forbidden actions return 403
   - Role hierarchy respect

2. **Department Boundary Tests**
   - Same department access allowed
   - Cross-department access denied
   - Emergency override working

3. **Patient Assignment Tests**
   - Nurse accessing assigned patient
   - Nurse denied unassigned patient
   - Doctor accessing any patient in department

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Inactive staff denied access
   - Missing session handling
   - Invalid department IDs

### Integration Tests Required
1. **End-to-End Workflows**
   - Complete visit creation process
   - Drug prescription to administration
   - Test ordering to result recording

2. **Security Penetration Tests**
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Session hijacking protection
   - SQL injection prevention

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### "Insufficient permissions" Error
1. Check staff role in database
2. Verify department assignment
3. Confirm patient assignment (for nurses)
4. Check session validity

#### Cross-Department Access Denied
1. Verify department type in database
2. Check if emergency override should apply
3. Confirm target department exists
4. Review special permission settings

#### Template Access Issues
1. Confirm template belongs to staff's department
2. Check role permissions for template operations
3. Verify template is active/available
